## Data Preparation

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Total Samples**: 793 calendar event descriptions
- **Format**: JSONL with `event_text` input and structured `output` JSON
- **Entity Fields**: 8 fields with varying presence rates
  - `action`: 100% present (required field)
  - `date`: 100% present (required field)
  - `time`: ~90% present, ~10% null
  - `location`: ~85% present, ~15% null
  - `duration`: ~60% present, ~40% null
  - `attendees`: ~30% present, ~70% null
  - `recurrence`: ~5% present, ~95% null
  - `notes`: ~5% present, ~95% null

### Data Processing Strategy

#### 1. Analysis Phase (`DataAnalyzer` class)
```python
# Key analysis components
- Text length distribution analysis
- Entity field presence statistics  
- Unique value counting per field
- Data quality assessment
```

**Reasoning**: Understanding data distribution is crucial for:
- Identifying potential bias in entity field representation
- Setting appropriate model input length limits
- Planning evaluation strategies for imbalanced fields

#### 2. Preprocessing (`DataPreprocessor` class)
```python
# Input format standardization
input_format = "Extract entities from: {event_text}"
output_format = "{structured_json}"
```

**Design Choice Rationale**:
- **Explicit instruction**: "Extract entities from:" provides clear task context
- **Consistent formatting**: Standardized input helps model learn the pattern
- **JSON output**: Structured format enables programmatic validation

#### 3. Data Splits
- **Training**: 70% (555 samples)
- **Validation**: 15% (119 samples)  
- **Test**: 15% (119 samples)

**Stratification Strategy**: Random splits with seed fixing for reproducibility. The relatively small dataset size necessitated careful split planning to ensure adequate representation across all entity types.

### Text Length Considerations
- **Average length**: ~47 characters
- **Max length**: 150+ characters
- **Model max_length**: 512 tokens (generous buffer for longer examples)

## Model Architecture & Design

### Base Model Selection: SmolLM-360M

**Why SmolLM-360M?**
1. **Size Efficiency**: 360M parameters provide good balance of capability vs. computational requirements
2. **Training Speed**: Smaller model enables faster iteration during development
3. **Deployment Friendly**: Reasonable memory footprint for production deployment
4. **Fine-tuning Responsive**: Smaller models often respond well to task-specific fine-tuning

### Custom Architecture Wrapper

#### EntityExtractionModel Class
```python
class EntityExtractionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config: ModelConfig):
        # Base model loading with appropriate precision
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
            config.model_name,
            torch_dtype=torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32,
            device_map="auto" if torch.cuda.is_available() else None
        )
        
        # Tokenizer setup with padding token handling
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(config.model_name)
        if self.tokenizer.pad_token is None:
            self.tokenizer.pad_token = self.tokenizer.eos_token
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Precision Optimization**: FP16 on GPU, FP32 on CPU for optimal performance
- **Device Mapping**: Automatic GPU utilization when available
- **Padding Token**: Essential for batch processing with variable-length inputs

### Custom Loss Function Design

#### Dual-Component Loss Architecture
```python
def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, labels=None):
    # Standard causal language modeling loss
    outputs = self.model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
    base_loss = outputs.loss
    
    # Custom entity-focused loss
    if self.training and labels is not None:
        entity_loss = self.compute_entity_loss(input_ids, logits, labels, attention_mask)
        total_loss = base_loss + self.config.entity_loss_weight * entity_loss
    
    return {'loss': total_loss, 'base_loss': base_loss, 'entity_loss': entity_loss}
```

#### Entity-Aware Loss Computation
```python
def compute_entity_loss(self, input_ids, logits, labels, attention_mask):
    # Identify output portion using separator token " → "
    # Apply focused loss only on entity extraction portion
    # Weight entity fields based on importance
```

**Innovation Rationale**:
1. **Task-Specific Focus**: Standard LM loss treats all tokens equally; our custom loss emphasizes entity extraction accuracy
2. **Output Portion Weighting**: Higher loss weight on the JSON output section
3. **Separator Token Strategy**: " → " clearly delineates input from expected output
4. **Configurable Weighting**: `entity_loss_weight` parameter allows tuning the balance

### Tokenization Strategy

#### Special Token Handling
- **Separator Token**: " → " (clear visual separation)
- **Padding Strategy**: Right-padding with attention mask
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens (accommodates longest examples with buffer)

**Reasoning**: The separator token approach provides:
- Clear boundary between instruction and expected output
- Visual clarity for human inspection during debugging
- Consistent pattern for model to learn

## Fine-tuning Strategy

### Custom PyTorch Training Implementation

#### Why Custom Training vs. HuggingFace SFTTrainer?
1. **Full Control**: Complete control over training loop, loss computation, and metrics
2. **Custom Loss Integration**: Seamless integration of our entity-aware loss function
3. **Specialized Evaluation**: Task-specific metrics during training
4. **Debugging Capability**: Direct access to all training components

#### Training Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    learning_rate: float = 5e-5          # Conservative LR for stable fine-tuning
    weight_decay: float = 0.01           # Regularization
    batch_size: int = 8                  # Memory-efficient batch size
    gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 4  # Effective batch size: 32
    num_epochs: int = 3                  # Prevent overfitting
    entity_loss_weight: float = 2.0      # Custom loss weighting
```

**Parameter Reasoning**:
- **Learning Rate (5e-5)**: Conservative rate prevents catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Achieves larger effective batch size (32) within memory constraints
- **Entity Loss Weight (2.0)**: Emphasizes task-specific learning without overwhelming base LM loss
- **Limited Epochs**: Small dataset requires careful overfitting prevention

#### Optimizer and Scheduling
```python
# AdamW with weight decay
optimizer = AdamW(optimizer_grouped_parameters, lr=config.learning_rate)

# Cosine annealing with warm restarts
scheduler = CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts(optimizer, T_0=warmup_steps)
```

**Scheduling Rationale**:
- **AdamW**: Proven effective for transformer fine-tuning
- **Cosine Annealing**: Smooth learning rate decay helps with convergence
- **Warm Restarts**: Allows model to escape local minima

#### Training Loop Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Loss tracking, learning rate logging
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients (max_norm=1.0)
3. **Automatic Checkpointing**: Best model saving based on validation performance
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed training metrics and progress tracking

### Memory and Computational Optimizations
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training on GPU for memory efficiency
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulates larger batch sizes
- **Device Mapping**: Automatic GPU utilization
- **Checkpoint Management**: Efficient model state saving/loading

## Evaluation Framework

### Multi-Level Evaluation Strategy

#### 1. Exact Match Accuracy
```python
exact_match = all(
    predicted_output.get(field) == true_output.get(field) 
    for field in entity_fields
)
```
**Purpose**: Measures perfect entity extraction performance

#### 2. Field-wise Accuracy
```python
field_accuracy = {
    field: correct_predictions / total_samples
    for field in entity_fields
}
```
**Purpose**: Identifies which entity types are most/least accurately extracted

#### 3. JSON Quality Assessment
```python
quality_metrics = {
    'valid_json': is_parseable_json(response),
    'has_all_fields': all_required_fields_present(parsed_json),
    'response_length': len(raw_response),
    'parse_error': json_parsing_error_details
}
```
**Purpose**: Ensures model generates well-formed, complete outputs

#### 4. F1 Metrics (Multiple Types)
```python
f1_metrics = {
    'exact_f1': exact_field_match_f1_score,
    'token_f1': token_level_f1_score,
    'binary_f1': presence_absence_f1_score
}
```

**F1 Metric Rationale**:
- **Exact F1**: Strict field-level matching
- **Token F1**: Partial credit for partially correct extractions
- **Binary F1**: Credit for correctly identifying field presence/absence
